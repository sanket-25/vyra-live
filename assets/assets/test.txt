Explosive Start: Focus on powerful leg pushes from the blocks for quicker acceleration.
Posture: Maintain a slight forward lean (5-10 degrees) with a neutral head position.
Stride Length: Increase stride length without overstriding.
Arm Mechanics: Keep arms at 90-degree angles, driving straight forward and backward.
Knee Lift: Ensure high knee drive in the acceleration phase.
Foot Placement: Land feet directly under your body, not in front, to avoid braking.
Speed Endurance: Work on maintaining top speed through the final meters.
Breathing: Focus on deep, controlled breathing to avoid tension.
Recovery: Allow 3-5 minutes rest between sprints for optimal recovery.
